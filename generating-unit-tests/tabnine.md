An Evaluation of Tabnine Pro
===============================

See [median_two_sorted_arrays.py](leetcode_problems/median_two_sorted_arrays.py) for the code used in this evaluation.

Tabnine proves to be an effective coding assistant. It's suggestions for simple code are often spot on. However as can
be seen with the given leetcode problem, harder logic is beyond it's capabilities. Here it's proven to occasionally be
wrong in ways that aren't immediately obvious. 

When it comes to unit test suggestions it seems to be more useful. However the suggestions still remain relatively 
simple. As with other coding assistants it proves to be effective at generating the simple cases and tests.
